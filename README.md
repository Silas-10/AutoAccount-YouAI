works on windows if you have python

do git clone of this repo (or download it)
do pip install -r requirements.txt
then do python run.py

it creates as many accounts you like, but it's lowkey slow asf - you can change the params tho

also, note that you'll have to change the chromedriver.exe file to whatever version of chrome you use, or at least the nearest version you can find here:
(three dots at top right of chrome > settings > about > version)
https://googlechromelabs.github.io/chrome-for-testing/

the version in this current repo is 126.0.6478.55

im prolly not gonna update this shit so enjoy while it lasts
